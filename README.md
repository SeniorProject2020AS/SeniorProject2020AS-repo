# SeniorProject2020AS-repo
The purpose of this repo was to improve the timings of components in an Ardruino assisted Spherification machine

Arduino IDE was used to code program and download onto the Arduino Uno SoC. 
Code was tested by running the Spherification machine and identifying mishaps with hardware components and/or end result of liquid.
